# Every optional key the parcel contract defines. CAPABILITIES below must be a
# subset of this — it exists so a typo in CAPABILITIES fails a test instead of
# silently dropping a carrier off a table on the docs site.
KNOWN_CAPABILITIES = frozenset(
    {"weight", "dimensions", "delivery_window", "pickup_point", "url", "history"}
)

# No confirmed field supplies weight, dimensions or an ETA window.
# ``pickup_point`` stays out too: the field names that would carry it only
# appear on the unconfirmed `final-destination` event, and we must not
# populate it from a guess (see parcels.py's ``normalize_parcel``). ``url``
# and ``history`` are both real. Revisit this the moment a locker-ready
# sample confirms the pickup-point field names.
CAPABILITIES = frozenset({"url", "history"})

# If this carrier ever grows a second backend with a genuinely different
# payload shape (a country-specific API, not just a config option), replace
# the single CAPABILITIES above with a CAPABILITIES_BY_VARIANT dict instead:
#
#   CAPABILITIES_BY_VARIANT = {
#       "Germany": frozenset({"pickup_point", "url", "history"}),
#       "Other": frozenset({"weight", "dimensions", "delivery_window",
#                            "pickup_point", "url", "history"}),
#   }
#
# Key order is display order on the docs site's comparison table; label each
# key exactly as the carrier's own country/backend selector does. The docs
# site's generator accepts either shape — don't declare both. Do not add this
# preemptively: a single-backend carrier (the common case) keeps the flat
# CAPABILITIES above.

# ``TRACKING_API_URL`` is the consumer tracking endpoint the integration polls:
# a single ``POST`` for every request, the tracking code goes in the JSON body
# (``{"parcelId": "<code>"}``), not the URL — see api.py. No auth: no cookie,
# API key or bearer token is sent. Response envelope is ``{"data": [...]}``,
# JSON, HTTP 200 on success. The exact body for an unknown parcelId was never
# captured (six consented live lookups only ever returned known parcels).
#
# ``TRACKING_URL`` is the human-facing deep link surfaced on each parcel's
# ``url`` field. The per-parcel path/query format was not in the six research
# samples; ``tracking.boxnow.gr`` (this file's earlier placeholder) does not
# even resolve (NXDOMAIN) — ``boxnow.gr`` does, and is the real, live,
# Cloudflare-fronted site. The ``/en?track=<parcelId>`` path is not
# independently confirmed by a captured 200 (Cloudflare bot-protection
# returns 403 for every path on this host, real code or not) — see
# carrier-research's api/tracking.md for the confidence tier on this field.
